    "\n",
    "In this section the Matlab Code example is implemented in Python below. Remember, that we are looking for the \"bottleneck\" of the graph by optimizing the size of the cut's minima. From the book:\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these concepts, we borrow an example problem with the corresponding Matlab code from (Gleich, 2006). We construct a randomly generated graph as follows. First, we partition $n$ = 1000 nodes in two groups $V_1$ and $V_2$ of sizes 450 and 550 nodes, respectively. Second, we connect any pair of nodes in the set $V_1$ (respectively $V2$) with probability 0.3 (respectively 0.2). Third and finally, any two nodes in distinct groups, $i ∈ V_1$ and $j ∈ V_2$, are connected with a probability of 0.1. The sparsity pattern of the associated adjacency matrix is shown in the left panel of Figure 6.6. No obvious partition is visible at first glance since the indices are not necessarily sorted, that is, $V_1$ is not necessarily {1, . . . , 450}. The second panel displays the sorted entries of the eigenvector $V_2$ showing a sharp transition between positive and negative entries. Finally, the third panel displays the correspondingly sorted adjacency matrix\n",
